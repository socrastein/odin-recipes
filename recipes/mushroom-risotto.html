    <h3>An uncomplicated version of a beloved Italian dish.</h3>
    <p>
        Since the stock is a big part of the flavor of this dish, <br>
        you can take things to the next level by simmering celery, carrots, <br>
        and onion in water to make a basic vegetable stock. The result is worth it!
