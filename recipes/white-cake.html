        <h3>A classic light, airy cake frosted with buttercream</h3>
        <p>
            This cake is flavored with almond extract instead of vanilla, which is an amazing flavor if you've never tried it. <br>
            You can always substitute vanilla flavor if you prefer or if you simply don't have almond extract.
        </p>

            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Grease two 9-inch pans. Line the bottom with parchment paper. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer to cream the butter and sugar together.<br>
                Beat in almond extract. Beat in sour cream until just combined.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Use a fork to combine the eggs and milk together in a bowl or 2 cup liquid measuring cup. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In another mixing bowl stir together cake flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix in until just combined.<br>
                Add in half of the milk mixture and combine.<br> 
                Add in another 1/3 of the dry ingredients until combined followed by the remainder of the milk mixture.<br> 
                Add in the remainder of the dry ingredients and mix with the hand mixer until just combined, using a rubber spatula<br> 
                to scrape the sides and bottom to make sure everything is mixed in.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes.<br> 
                Let sit in pans for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before layering and frosting.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Buttercream Frosting</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Use a hand mixer to whip softened butter and almond extract together. Slowly add in <br>
            powdered sugar, about 1 cup at a time. Thin out with milk if it gets too thick.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>You can either use the 1 cup milk or buttermilk plus .5 cups sour cream, or you can omit the <br>
        sour cream and simply use 1.5 cups of milk or buttermilk.</p>
